# Inkling Overview

This reference contains comprehensive specifications and usage for the Inkling language, Bonsaiâ€™s special purpose programming language for training AI.

Inkling is a declarative, strongly typed language that provides a layer of
abstraction between the Inkling programmer and the vast and dynamic set of AI
algorithms that require expertise in machine learning. Inkling allows you to
focus at a conceptual level on what you want the machine to learn. That is why this model of
programming is called pedalogical programming. 

An Inkling file contains the concepts (what you want to teach the AI), and curriculum (how you want to teach the concepts) necessary to train your BRAIN.
